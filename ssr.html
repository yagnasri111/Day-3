<h4>2015–2018: Dhoni biopic, Raabta and Kedarnath</h4>
<p>In 2011, a biopic on the life of the Indian cricket team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was conceived by Dhoni's manager, Arun Pandey.[68] The project was initially faced with various difficulties including objections from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and Dhoni's demand for a large royalty.[69][70] On 25 September 2014, Sushant Singh Rajput was announced as the actor who would play the role of Dhoni in the biopic which was titled M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story and directed by Neeraj Pandey.[69][71] The film was centered around the life of the cricketer beginning with his childhood in the city of Ranchi and leading up to the 2011 Cricket World Cup victory for India under his captaincy.[47] Incidentally, Rajput wasn't adept at cricket and had to train regularly in the game for 13 months as well as capture the playing style of Dhoni for his portrayal in the film,[68] he was coached by Kiran More who reportedly trained him in the regimen of a professional sportsperson rather than as an actor.[72] The film was produced by Arun Pandey with Fox Star Studios and released on 2 October 2016.[73] It became the 5th highest grossing Bollywood film of that year.[74] Rajput received critical acclaim for his performance and nominations to a number of awards,[2] including the Filmfare Awards, the International Indian Film Academy Awards and the winning nomination at the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne.[75][42][76] He also made a cameo appearance in the comedy film Welcome to New York,[77] which was released on 23 February 2018 and where the lead characters met Rajput but confused him for Mahendra Singh Dhoni.[78]<br>

During the release of M. S. Dhoni: The Untold Story, Rajput in an interview had stated that he was signed up to do five more films; namely Raabta, Takadum, Chanda Mama Door Ke, another biopic of an athlete and a film produced by Dharma Productions featuring Jacqueline Fernandez.[79] Earlier in 2014, reports had emerged that Rajput was being signed in alongside Alia Bhatt for the starring roles in the largest budget production of the producer–directors Homi Adajania and Dinesh Vijan.[80] In an announcement in February 2015, the film titled Raabta, produced by the Vijan owned Maddock Films and co-directed by Adajania and Vijan was publicised where Rajput and Bhatt were in the lead role.[81] Bhatt however decided to opt out of the project in the same year,[82] and the role of the female lead eventually went to Kriti Sanon.[83] Rajput and Sanon later featured in a 2017 T-Series music video of the song named Paas Aao, composed by the duo Armaan and Amaal Mallik.[84] In 2017, he was featured for first time in the Forbes India's Top 100 Celebrity list.[4]</p>

<h2>Personal life</h2><hr>
<p>Rajput's personal relationships have been the subject of widespread media attention.[156][157] In 2011, Rajput publicly proposed to his Pavitra Rishta co-star Ankita Lokhande during a national broadcast of the dance competition show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa;[32] both of them had participated in the show as competing contestants.[158] The couple began dating after their first meeting on the set of Pavitra Rishta, where they had been cast as husband and wife to each other.[159] In 2012, they began living together,[160] and reports of an imminent marriage between the two occasionally cropped up in the media.[161] In an interview, Rajput stated that marriage and cohabitation were no different and that it was hypocritical to treat the former as sacred and the latter as a crime.[162][163] At an event, he had said, "I am very transparent about my relationships. I mean I will not hesitate to say that I am in a relationship".[164]<br>

In 2014, rumours that they were already secretly married due to family pressure[165] were denied by the couple.[166] In January 2016, Rajput confirmed that a lavish wedding would take place in December,[167] but the relationship ended prior to that, with the pair maintaining silence on the reasons for the cancellation.[168] In a 2021 interview, Lokhande said that Rajput wanted to go ahead in his career and they ended their relationship mutually.[169]</p>

<h2>Death</h2><hr>
<p>On 14 June 2020, Rajput, aged 34, was found dead in his home in Bandra, Mumbai.[1][184] He had reportedly shown signs of clinical depression and had bipolar disorder.[185][186][187] The postmortem report stated that the cause of death was "asphyxia due to hanging" and called it a "clear case of suicide."[188] Authorities and a forensic medical team from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, confirmed that Rajput's death was not murder.[189][190][191]<br>

On 25 July, Rajput's family lodged a first information report with police in Patna, where his father lives, accusing Rhea Chakraborty and five others of abetment of suicide.[192]<br>

On 31 July, Enforcement Directorate (ED) filed a case to investigate the money laundering of Rajput's money from his bank accounts by Chakraborty, her parents and associates.[193] On 19 August 2020, the Supreme Court of India allowed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Indian national government's top investigating agency, to take control of the investigation[194] and ordered the CBI to look into any future cases registered in relation to Rajput's death.[195] Later, the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) also filed a case to investigate drug peddling, based on phone chats forwarded to it by ED during its investigation.[196]<br>

On 8 September, Rhea Chakraborty was arrested by the NCB in a drug case linked to the investigation of the death probe. Prior to the arrest, 9 others were arrested by the NCB in the drug case including Rhea's brother, Showik Chakraborty.[197] On 12 July 2022, the NCB filed draft charges against 35 people, including Rhea Chakraborty and her brother. The NCB claimed that Rajput had been using numerous people to obtain drugs since 2018 and accused his flatmate Pithani and others of "aiding and abetting" Rajput to "extreme drug addiction."[198]</p>
